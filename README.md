# Hone

Hone is an art journal web application. It allows artists to upload images of their art, keep track of their progress and if they choose, to share their art with others. The name “hone” comes from the idea of honing one's skill.  Unique functionalities include submissions of projects with various entries, a calendar to display projects, streaks to improve motivation, and a gallery of randomly selected entries for inspiration.
